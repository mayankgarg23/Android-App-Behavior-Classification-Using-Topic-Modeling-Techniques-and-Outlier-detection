Checking App Behaviour Against App Description

• To check whether the android app is behaving as advertised or not.

• To check whether an app can be malicious for the user as if it is accessing the user’s device without permission or if it is accessing that information that this kind of apps doesn’t require.

• Fetched app description from Google play store by the method of crawling.

• Implemented natural language processing to remove stopwords and filter language.

• Implemented Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling.

• Formed clusters of related apps and extracted android apps (APK) files.

• Decrypted manifest files to extract permissions and sensitive API's used by the app.

• Detected the outliers i.e. the apps that could be malicious for users.
